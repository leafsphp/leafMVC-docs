# LeafMVC

Leaf MVC is a simple PHP framework that allows you to create powerful web apps and APIs quickly and efficiently. Leaf MVC is powered by the [Leaf Core](https://leaf-docs.netlify.com) and is based on the Ruby on Rails and Laravel frameworks.

# Getting Started
## Installation
With LeafMVC, you can whip up a full MVC app in a couple of seconds. Leaf MVC's recommended mode of installation is with [composer](https://getcomposer.org).
```bash
composer create-project leafs/mvc <project-name>
```
This will create a LeafMVC project and install all dependencies. Also, a `.env` file will be created for you.
You can serve your project with 
```bash
php leaf serve
```

In LeafMVC, ***app*** is where all your development goes on. “app” contains all your **models**, **views**(templates), **controllers**, **routes**, **custom console commands**, **helpers** and database related stuff(**migrations**, **seeds…**).


***config*** contains all the app configurations…configuration for routes, database, the leaf console, error handling, session, templating…however, you normally have no business with this folder


***public*** holds web configuration😅😅.


***storage*** holds all the app data, it contains both framework data and user files. For instance, uploaded files and pictures are kept in storage/app/public


***vendor*** holds all of leafMVC’s dependencies


## Basic Usage
LeafMVC is created with Leaf Core, hence, you can still use the Leaf Code you're used to.<br>
`app/routes/routes.php`
```javascript
<?php
$leaf->get('/home', function() use($response) {
  $response->respond(['Message' => 'Hello World']);
});
```
Just enter this code and run `php leaf serve` and navigate to localhost:3000
It's that simple to build with LeafMVC
