# Leaf Console 
This is a simple tool to help with project scaffolding. With this tool, you don't have to write your own models, migrations...from scratch. This console uses the `php` console, so you should have php path defined

## Console Commands
In your console, you can run `php leaf` or `php leaf list` to view all supported commands. Alternatively, here are all supported commands:

```bash
Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:

      --ansi            Force ANSI output
